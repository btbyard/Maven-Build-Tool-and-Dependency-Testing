# CS305-Portfolio
Module 8 final portfolio submission

TASK TO COMPLETE:
I worked on this project as a developer for Global Rain, an engineering company that specializes in custom software design and development for entrepreneurs, businesses, and government agencies around the world. At this company, part of the mission is that “Security is everyone’s responsibility.” I have been promoted to the newly formed agile scrum team for Global Rain.

For this project I was tasked with working with a client, Artemis Financial. This client is a financial consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for their patrons. Artemis Financial desires to modernize its operations and, as a crucial part of the success of its custom software, they want to implement and apply the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web application programming interface (API) and is seeking Global Rain’s expertise in taking steps to protect the organization from external threats.

As part of the team, I was tasked with examining Artemis Financial’s web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities in their current software. Your assessment will be used to complete a vulnerability assessment report for mitigating the security vulnerabilities that you identify.

WHAT WAS FOUND
I went through and wrote updated encryption methods using AES encryption keep AF's software modern and secure. I scanned AF's software and found many vulnerabilites that were labeled as "critical" and "high" vulnerabilites with high CVE counts. 

WHAT WAS DONE: 
I used Maven build tool for this, which was tough for me at first to get Maven and the Spring framework to run correctly in Eclipse IDE, but I was able to get it work. Running a maven dependancy check was very helpful. It showed me problems and I was able to fix them. I updated all dependencies to current versions and most problems went away with aonther dependencie check. I also recomended these secure practices to AF:

•	Patch your software
•	Educate and train users
•	Automate Routine Tasks
•	Enforce Least Privilege
•	Document your security policies. 
•	Monitor user Activity
